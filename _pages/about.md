<!-- ## 👋 About Me -->

I’m a PhD candidate in Cognitive Neuroscience at UC Irvine, with a strong background in artificial intelligence (MS in AI, BS in Software Engineering). My research focuses on understanding how the brain represents uncertainty and how these insights can inform and improve modern machine learning models. I work closely with neuroimaging, computational modeling, and generative AI systems.

I'm currently working on neural encoding models and using fMRI data to understand high-level representations of uncertainty in the brain. I also design and analyze experiments using tools like DecNef and reinforcement learning-based generative models (e.g., the NERD model).
